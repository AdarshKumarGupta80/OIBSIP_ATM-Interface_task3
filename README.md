ATM Interface

Objective

The goal of this project is to simulate an ATM interface using Java, providing users with basic banking operations via a console-based application. The project demonstrates object-oriented principles by implementing multiple classes for managing ATM functions.

Steps Performed
User Authentication:
Prompts users for their ID and PIN to secure access to the ATM system.

Transaction Operations:
Once authenticated, users can perform several actions:

View transaction history

Withdraw funds

Deposit funds

Transfer money to another account

Quit the application

Data Management:
The project maintains user transaction history.

Tools Used
Programming Language: Java

IDE: Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans)

Platform: Console/Terminal

Outcome
Users experience a secure, console-based ATM application that simulates real-world transactions. The application showcases secure authentication, clean user interface, and basic banking operations using object-oriented programming in Java
